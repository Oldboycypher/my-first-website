# My Very First Web Page

# Welcome!

## Overview:

#### Hi, this is my first website created following the course instructions in the Full Stack Web Developer course delivered online via The Code Institute. It was built using HTML5 and CSS3; build was in Cloud9 IDE which required Git, and also has a repository for saving/viewing on GitHub.
#### The site is an overview of all the technologies used across 3 learning streams that are covered in the course from start to finish. As you can see, most of the technologies mentioned above, are covered in Stream One as this is the portion of the course using these building blocks to build the site.
#### The 3 streams are visible in a navigation bar at the top of the page. Simply click on each of these and you will see icons for each of the technologies to be covered in each stream. These icons in turn also link to information pages for each of them.

#### Enjoy!
